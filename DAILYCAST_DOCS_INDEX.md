## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS

**Two-Level Configuration**

- Global defaults (apply to everyone)
- Group overrides (apply to specific users)
- Blank field = use global default
- Filled field = override global

**Settings Hierarchy**

1. Check if user in a group
2. If yes, check if group has override
3. If override exists, use it
4. Otherwise, use global default
5. If no group, use all globals

**Naming Clarity**

- "Global Podcast Defaults" = For everyone
- "Student Groups" = Groups of users
- "Category Overrides" = Per-group settings
