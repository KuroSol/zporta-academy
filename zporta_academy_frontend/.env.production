# Environment variables for production build (used by `npm run build`)

# Use a relative path for the API endpoint.
# The browser will request /api relative to the domain it's on (e.g., http://44.214.18.213/api).
# Nginx is configured to proxy requests starting with /api/ to your backend.
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=/api

# Add the production Stripe key here if needed (loaded during build)
# Example: REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_PROD_KEY

# IMPORTANT: Any changes here require rebuilding the app (`npm run build`) on the server.
